A higher factor will increase the variation on work arrival and departure - meaning more cims will not arrive to work on time or work for longer hours. A value of zero will disable this feature. Note that the effects of this feature in the morning and evening peak hours is different: in the morning there is an equal probabilty of early or late arrival, however, in the evening the probability of leaving late is higher than of leaving early. This was implemented this way to simulate better the differences of morning and evening commute from the real world.",
